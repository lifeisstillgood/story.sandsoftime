I woke up with a deep chill of excitement run through my spine it was my 11th birthday and it had been 4 years since my dad left but today was about me and I am not going to let anything or anyone stop that. By the way I am Emilia but everyone calls me Emmie and I am going to be 11 so since you are going to read this book I may as well introduce you to my family I have no siblings and I have a mum because my father went missing when I was 8 but I also have a best friend called Izzy we have been best friend scince preschool 

as usual, it is another day and just because it is my birthday doesn't mean I can skip school but believe me if i could I would so I stretch out my arm struggling to keep my eyes open and i turn off the dreaded sound of my alarm clock.

I get up and get dressed to start my usual birthday tradition when it is a family member's birthday we always gather downstairs in the living room and open presents and breakfast is always chosen by the family member whose birthday it is and of course it is always waffles or pancakes for me and as i walk downstairs mum greets me halfway and we walk down together as I slowly tear the wrapping paper off my present I see a black box and it was a new coding computer in case you didn't know I love coding and programming computers I am a head of my class in computer science but besides that I expect only one birthday card and it would be from izzy I went to check the mail as mum made breakfast but I found two letters
